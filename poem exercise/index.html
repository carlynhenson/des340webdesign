    <h3>Canto I</h3>
    <p>IN the midway of this our mortal life,<br>
    I found me in a gloomy wood, astray<br>
    Gone from the path direct: and e'en to tell<br>
    It were no easy task, how savage wild<br>
    That forest, how robust and rough its growth,<br>
    Which to remember only, my dismay<br>
    Renews, in bitterness not far from death.<br>
    Yet to discourse of what there good befell,<br>
    All else will I relate disover'd there.<br>
    How first I enter'd it I scarce can say,<br>
    Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh'd<br>
    My senses down, when the true path I left,<br>
    But when a mountain's foot I reach'd, where clos'd<br>
    The valley that had pierc'd my heart with dread,<br>
    I look'd aloft, and saw his shoulder broad<br>
    Already vested with that planet's beam,<br>
    Who leads all wanderes safe through every way.<br>
    <br>
    Then was a little respite to the fear,<br>
    That in my heart's recesses deep had lain,<br>
    All of that night, so pitifully pass'd:<br>
    And as a man, with difficult short breath,<br>
    Forespent with toiling, 'scap'd from sea to shore,<br>
    Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands<br>
    At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that yet fail'd<br>
    Struggling with terror, turn'd to view the straits,<br>
    That none hath pass'd and liv'd. My weary frame<br>
    After short pause recomforted, again<br>
    I journey'd on oer that linely steep,<br>
    </p>
